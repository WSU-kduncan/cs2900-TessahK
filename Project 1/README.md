## Part 1
I opened VirtualBox and created and selected Linux as my VM type and Ubuntu as my version. I allocated 2048 MB of RAM. I then selected VDI as my virtual hard disk file type. I am dynamically allocating storage so that way it does not immediately take up all the space that I give it. I chose the reccomended size and gave my VM 10GB of storage. In the storage settings of my VM I added an Ubuntu 20.04 ISO. After completing the installation process, I inserted the guest additions CD, which will install drivers that allow for better screen resolution and mouse integration. I clicked run on the pop-up and it completed the installation. I rebboted my VM and resized the window so that it is now full screen. I also went into the display settings and turned on 3D acceleration.
